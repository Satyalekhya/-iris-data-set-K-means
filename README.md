# -iris-data-set-K-means
This is iris dataset . I have used the k means algorithm for this dataset .
First - step : Business understanding - The purpose of the project is predict the optimium number of clusters and represinting visually 
Second - step : Data Understanding - The Iris dataset contains of 6 features and those are id, sepal length and width , petal legth and width , species . The total number of rows are 150*6 
Third - step : Data preparation : Cleaning of dataset invovles of replacing null values and redundancy of data 
Fourth - step : Modelling : In this step i have choose the model as K- Means algorithm for predicting the optimium number of clusters . 
Fifth - step : Evaluation : In this step after spilting the dataset into train and test model and check the working procedure 
Sixth - step : Deployment : The final result is here obtaining the optimium number of clusters and represinting visually
